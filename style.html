        <h1>Why I decided to become a Web-Developer</h1>
        <h2>I started as an observer in and around Los Angeles.  After a solid two years of developing a personal training business under the umbrella of Equinox, it hit me.  I started to see a growing demand for web-developers and it seemed prudent to do some research.</h2>
        <p>Before I'd decided to dig for pearls of wisdom, I was a personal trainer by trade. As a personal trainer, I would encounter members who were moving into the Santa Monica area from all over the country. Some of the members were fresh out of college, and some were just looking to make a career change.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until I decided to move back to Las Vegas, that the thought of becoming a developer really settled. 1 month before I officially moved from Culver City (Ca), I took my first steps towards becoming a developer by purchasing a year subscription to <em>Codeacademy.com</em>, after completing the first two modules (20+ hours of course-work), I was hooked.
